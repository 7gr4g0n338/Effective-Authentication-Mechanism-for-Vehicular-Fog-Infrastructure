# Effective Authentication Mechanism for Vehicular Fog Infrastructure

## Abstract
Recently, a tangible vehicular fog computing (VFC)
platform based on oneM2M, called oneVFC, has been proposed.
This platform enabled federated AI learning, but did not include
sufficient attention to security. Therefore, this paper proposes
an effective authentication and key agreement protocol based
on the Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to enhance privacy
preservation in an authenticated way in order to ensure safer AI
training. Experimental results show that the proposed authentication mechanisms make reliable transmissions in highly-mobile
vehicular networks possible, resulting in a desirable quality of
service (QoS). The performance and security strength of two
authenticated encryption modes of AES, GCM and CCM, are
also compared and evaluated.
